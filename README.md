Shoipping Application

This is a shopping mobile application that is built in react-native with expo configurations. What we can do in this application is, we can add our own products, we can sell them and also if you want to buy something it is available too. For this project, I have not used firebase service as a backend, but I have used ExpressJs as a backend framework. No static data! everything will be served by the server app.

What you can't see is the authentication system. I have built an authentication system in OAuth2.0. This is a simple token-based authentication system, where you can generate access tokens, refresh tokens, and so on. If you want to learn this then the link is given below. Happy coding guys.  

Point to be noted: Do something great today.
